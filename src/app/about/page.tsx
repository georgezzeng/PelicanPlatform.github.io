                Objects in a federation are accessible through a common namespace; given an object name, the Pelican client can discover the object’s 
                location and download it through the access layer. The access layer consists of distributed caches which reduce the load on the 
                origin for repeated accesses.

                    A Pelican data federation provides an access layer that helps the origin distribute datasets in the repositories. A client wanting 
                    an object contacts the manager to find the closest cache which either serves the objects from local storage or streams it through the origin.

                Central to Pelican is the concept of the origin service. The origin is the intermediary between the existing storage and the federation. The origin 
                is responsible for serving data as well as issuing tokens (credentials) authorizing access to datasets based on the local policy.
